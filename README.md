# The Gravity and The Balls
 
## Completed physics task - Simulation of ball physics with gravity and colsisions 
### âœ… Tasks [**[Final Effect Preview](https://youtu.be/lu5_pctjIXQ)**]:
- Every 1/4 second a ball is created in the camera field of view
- Text counter shows how many balls have been created so far
- Each ball has its own gravitational field - it attracts other balls
- Each ball has its own gravitational field - it attracts other balls
- In the event of a collision, two balls merge into one with a proportionally greater mass and gravitational field
- If a ball has a mass corresponding to the mass of 50 original balls, it disintegrates disintegrates into as many balls as it is made of. These balls fly with a high speed in random directions with collision disabled for half a second
- The balls stop forming when there are 250 balls in total - then their gravitational fields
- The balls stop forming when there are 250 balls in total
- After generating 250 balls, their gravitational fields start working in reverse - the balls repel each other; the balls stop connecting to each other, although collisions are still detected and the balls do not overlap
- The balls do not move in a vacuum, so they should slow down while moving - simulation of air resistance
- No other gravitational forces act on the balls
